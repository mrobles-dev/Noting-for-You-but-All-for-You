# Noting for You but All for You

## Description

This project was meant to satisfy a user story, wherein a user wanted to be able to save notes.

- This allowed me practice utilizing express.js
- What's more important is how I can integrate the routes correctly
- My toughest challenge was figuring out why my routes weren't working though my data was posting


## Usage

Follow link hosted by Heroku to write and save notes!
